We are presented with a `pcap` file.

<aside>
üí°

Packet capture is a networking practice involving the interception of data packets travelling over a network. Once the packets are captured, they can be stored by IT teams for further analysis. The inspection of these packets allows IT teams to identify issues and¬†solve network problems¬†affecting daily operations.

The most common tool used to work on these packets is Wireshark.

With Right Click‚ÜíFollow‚ÜíTCP Stream we get to see the whole ‚Äúconversation‚Äù. There‚Äôs a bit that seems promising:

```bash
Password: 
ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L
```

Some characters are not printable, so let‚Äôs see what they really are with the HexDump view:

```bash

000000C4  4e                                                 N
000000C5  44                                                 D

000000C7  65                                                 e
000000C8  6c                                                 l
000000C9  7f                                                 .

000000CB  30                                                 0
000000CC  4c                                                 L
000000CD  0d                                                 .
```

`7f` is `del`. Let‚Äôs try to reconstruct what was actually typed: 

ft_wandr`<del x3>`NDRel`<del>`L0L`<enter>` which adds up to `ft_waNDReL0L` .

That‚Äôs the password for `flag02`!

```bash
level02@SnowCrash:~$ su flag02
Password: 
Don't forget to launch getflag !
flag02@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq
```
